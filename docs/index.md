This wiki is up-to-date with the following BlurEngine version: Alpha 1.5.2

BlurEngine is a rather simple game engine, with a scripting API for use with Lua.

With that being said, welcome to the wiki!

**I would like to thank everyone that has tried, or contributed any amount of testing to BlurEngine. Without you this project probably wouldn't have lasted even a few months.</br></br> I especially would like to give my thanks to: Kip, Bartekrabit, brudziak and nickname2500**

*If you find any errors/inconsistencies in either the engine or this wiki, or just have suggestions for the wiki or the engine please contact me.*
