BlurEngine is a rather simple game engine, with the main scripting API being implemented in Lua.

With that being said, welcome to the wiki!

This is the rewrite of the previously, hastily written documentation wiki. Hopefully this will suffice to help ease people into the new updates.

Here are the main links:

- For global functions please click [here](functions.md)
- For global events, click [here](events.md).
- For libraries, click [here](libraries/libraries.md).
- For classes and their properties/functions/events click here:

*If you find any errors/inconsistencies in either the engine or this wiki, or just have suggestions for the wiki or the engine please contact me.*
